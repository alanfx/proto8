    * DESIGN RATIONALES:
    * <ul>
    *    <li>Why does ReadEntryView expose both get() and find() methods for
    *    retrieving the value? Convenience. If the caller knows for sure
    *    that the value will be present, get() offers the convenience of
    *    retrieving the value directly without having to get an {@link Optional}
    *    first.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>Why have find() return {@link Optional}? Why not get rid of it and only have
    *    get() method return null? Because nulls are evil. If a value might not
    *    be there, the user can use {@link Optional} to find out if the value might
    *    be there and deal with non-present values in a more functional way.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>Why does get() throw NoSuchElementException? Because you should only
    *    use it if you know for sure that the value will be there. If unsure,
    *    use find(). We don't want to return null to avoid people doing null checks.
    *    </li>
