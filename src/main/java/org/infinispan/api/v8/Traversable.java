/**
 * Unsorted traversable stream. Design is inspired on {@link java.util.stream.Stream}.
 * Some functions that would be typically found in {@link java.util.stream.Stream}
 * are not included here:
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li>{@link java.util.stream.Stream#distinct()}: This operation would be
 *    extremely costly in a distributed environment as all data up to that
 *    point of the traversable stream must be read by a single node.
 *    Due to the memory and performance constraints this method wouldn't be supported.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>{@link java.util.stream.Stream#sorted()}: Providing a sorted
 *    traversable stream in a distributed environment is an expensive operation.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>{@link java.util.stream.Stream#limit(long)}: In a distributed
 *    environment this would require sequential requests for each node to
 *    verify that we haven't reached the limit yet. This could be optimized
 *    depending on the terminator. This operation makes most sense when
 *    combined with sorted streams.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>{@link java.util.stream.Stream#sorted()}: Operation that makes
 *    most sense when combined with sorting.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>{@link java.util.stream.Stream#forEachOrdered(Consumer)}:
 *    Sorting related.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>{@link java.util.stream.Stream#toArray()}: Creating an array
 *    requires size to be computed first, and then populate it, making it a
 *    potentially expensive operation in a distributed operation. Also,
 *    there are other ways to achieve this, such as mapping to a variable
 *    length collection and then narrowing it down to an array?
 *    </li>
 *    <li>{@link java.util.stream.Stream#collect(java.util.stream.Collector)}:
 *    This method is designed to work with {@link java.util.stream.Collectors},
 *    whose static methods are used as helpers functions, but these are not
 *    Serializable, and we'd need to investigate whether we can provide
 *    marshallable versions. Also, {@link java.util.stream.Collectors} brings
 *    in a lot of baggage. Instead, {@link #collect(Supplier, BiConsumer, BiConsumer)}
 *    should be used.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>{@link java.util.stream.Stream#findFirst()}: The only difference
 *    with {@link #findAny()} is ordering, so since we do not want to enter
 *    the ordering business, we leave it out.</li>
 * </ul>

   // TODO: In distributed environments, where the lambdas passed are executed could matter a lot:
   // For example, for filtering, the predicate would be better run directly
   // in the source of data, rather than bring all data and filter it locally.
   // If the default would to run lambdas at the data source, there's a couple
   // of things considering:
   //    1. How to marshall a predicate without forcing the predicate to be Serializable.
   //       SerializedLambda exposes how serialization works, we'd need to apply a
   //       similar thing caching as much as we can.
   //    2. Have a way to tweak lambda executions to happen locally instead of
   //       at data source. This would be useful for operations such as
   //       peek() and for each. This could easily be done with a new Param.
   //       This option is also handy for situations where the lambda captures
   //       objects that simply cannot be marshalled.
