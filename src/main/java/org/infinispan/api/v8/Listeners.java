/**
 * Listener definitions.
 *
 * DESIGN RATIONALE:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>The current set of listener events that can be fired are related
 *    to modifications, and deciding between create or modify, or providing
 *    removed entry information, require reading the previous value. Hence,
 *    the current set of listeners can only be provided for read-write maps.
 *    In the future, if for example cache entry visited events are to be
 *    supported, those would need to be associated with either a read or
 *    read-write map, and hence the listeners interface would most likely
 *    be split up.
 *    </li>
